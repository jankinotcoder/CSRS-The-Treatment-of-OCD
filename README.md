File: CSRS - The Treatment of OCD

• Collaborated with a 4-member team to develop a Clinical Study Report Synopsis (CSRS) for a two-phase, multi-center OCD clinical trial involving pediatric and adolescent patients.

• Summarized clinical trial design and methodology, including screening, randomization, dosage, visit schedules, and outcomes assessments.

• In order to effectively convey the research drug’s properties, dosage, and administration, an organized product information table and text were created.

• Results for age and dose-based subgroups were examined, with an emphasis on treatment response patterns,
tolerability, and recurring rates.

• Ensured compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), FDA regulations, and the Declaration of Helsinki in ethics
and informed consent reporting.

• Enhanced abilities in regulatory writing, clinical data interpretation, and team-based project management through this project collaboration.
